= Description
Nothing serious here: Just a simple ruby script written in a gray morning to generate a SINATRA application with a basic tree (the way I like it), 
with an automatic git setup and heroku deployment. It also shotguns the application for you on 0.0.0.0, opens Safari and sends the project to Textmate. 
Do I need to TELL YOU that this is 100% tailored for my macBook  and you need some gems for it to work (and today I'm too lazy to add more code..) ?
THANKS! :)
